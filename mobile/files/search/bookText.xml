         It  is  an  absolute  honour  to  serve  as  the  president  of  Colombo
         University Alumni Association of Victoria and to work with a group
         of dedicated committee members to achieve our shared vision and
         goals. Thanks to the tireless efforts of my committee, CUAAV was
         able to organise several events in 2022, engaging its members with
         other university alumni members and the wider community.

         2022 is a successful year. Colombo – Japura cricket match was
         played with the spirit of camaraderie and the occasion was made
         even  more  special  by  the  DJ  and  Papare  music  playing  in  the
         backdrop. We had several new young and talented players joining
         our team this year. Both alumni members and their families had a
         great  time  and  had  the  opportunity  to  establish  and  extend
         friendships within and between the universities. CUAAV Members
         and their families participated in the Clean-up Australia Day where they joined hands with a local community
         organisation to clean up the Bellbird Dell Reserve in Vermont. The blood and plasma donation drive in
         collaboration with Red Cross Australia was successfully held in three different locations covering Northern,
         Western and Eastern suburbs of Melbourne and we had more than 30 alumni, family members and friends
         taking part this year.


         Inter  Alumni  Musical  Night  was  another  successful  event  jointly  organised  by  the  alumni  chapters  of
         University of Colombo VIC and NSW for the second time. It was a unique musical experience for both
         alumni  members  and  friends  around  the  world  with  live  streaming  via  Zoom  and  Facebook  while
         participation of Sri Lankan guest artists. The Victorian side of the musical night event was extended as a
         much-awaited get-together with karaoke night followed by a buffet dinner. Another objective of this event
         was  to  formally  launch  the  Facebook  fundraising  campaign  in  support  of  CUAAV  ‘Nanasata  Saviyak’
         scholarship program helping the University of Colombo undergraduates from all faculties who are facing
         financial hardships. Our target was to raise funds for 50 scholarships. This was the first time the CUAAV
         had used a social media platform to raise funds. I am delighted to announce that we have successfully
         raised the funds for about 75 scholarships as planned for this year. I would like to thank all the University
         of  Colombo  graduates,  their  families,  friends  and  distinguished  guests  for  attending  this  event.  I  also
         appreciate support received from Dr Ruwangi Chandrasekara, Dr Rajitha Silva, Vice Chancellor and past
         scholarship recipients in creating videos for fundraiser.

         Our main event, Colombo Night 2022 was held after three years due to COVID-19 pandemic and resulting
         restrictions. It was a very successful event and there were more than 280 participants. In addition to raising
         funds for important community projects and providing networking opportunities, this eagerly awaited get-
         together brings friends and family members of our alumni together for a wonderful evening of music, dancing
         and companionship. CUAAV committee organised a free education seminar in relation to the current most
         valuable  topic  ‘Property  Investment  Strategies  to  Make  You  Wealthy’  with  the  participation  of  three
         professional speakers for our alumni.

         As a responsible Association in Australia, CUAAV supported three fundraisers in Australia in this year. We
         supported ‘Suwayata Saviyak’ fundraiser and ‘Ride for Apeksha’, which were aimed at helping to hospitals
         in our motherland. We have also donated money to The Melbourne Royal Children’s Hospital Foundation.

         My sincere thanks go to the committee members for their continued commitment. I also acknowledge our
         past presidents and ex-committee members for their continuous support and encouragement. Further, I
         take this opportunity to thank all our sponsors and partners for their generous contributions and support for
         the events during the year.

         Finally,  thank  you  so  much  for  our  alumni,  their  families  and  friends  for  their  continued  support,
         understanding and encouragement and I would also like to invite alumni living in Australia to join with us to
         make the Association stronger.

         It’s with great pleasure that I write this message on the occasion
         of 2022 Annual General Meeting. First, I would like to congratulate
         you all on your achievements after graduating from University of
         Colombo. As of July 2022, our university is ranked as the number
         one  prestigious  university  in  Sri  Lanka  according  to  the
         webometrics ranking index of universities and 1531 in the world
         rank.  University  of  Colombo  provides  education  facilities  for
         13,000 undergraduates and more than 12,000 external, distant,
         and postgraduate students.

         As you are aware, the per capita income of Sri Lanka has been
         less  than  USD  4000.  In  addition,  Sri  Lanka  has  been  facing  a
         series of crises such as the Easter attack, COVID-19 pandemic,
         economic crisis, fuel crisis, food crisis, political crisis, and social
         crisis during the past 4 years. As a result, many of the faculties and institutes of the University of Colombo
         had to operate in online mode while the Faculty of Medicine remained open throughout the period. Since
         2021, most faculties and institutes shifted to multimode education. Today, we follow a blended learning
         approach,  which  mixes  physical  lectures,  practical  training,  and  examinations  while  conducting  online
         lectures. Our ultimate goal is to reach 100% physical operation as early as possible. However, universities
         in Sri Lanka are running with great difficulties due to the significant cut down of government annual monetary
         allocations. The government of Sri Lanka has issued several financial circulars to cut down its expenditure
         on universities.


         I would like to thank Colombo University Alumni Association Victoria for the contribution made towards the
         University of Colombo by providing scholarships to undergraduate students. It has been very helpful to the
         underprivileged students at the university. In addition to academic development of students, the University
         of Colombo is committed to developing extracurricular activities such as sports, language skills, performing
         arts-related activities such as music, dancing, and cultural programs, speech craft competitions, leadership
         development  programs,  ICT  skills,  financial  literacy  programs,  and  entrepreneurship  development
         programs. I hope networking with your alumni association is important to implement these activities in the
         university for students.

         Looking forward to years ahead, the University of Colombo seeks your continuous support in cooperative
         and collaborative areas such as improvement of living conditions in hostels, development of extracurricular
         activities, finding internship opportunities for (final year) students, initiating student exchange programs with
         universities in Australia, and mentoring students through virtual fostering programs, etc.


         I congratulate CUAAV on another great year of achievements and wish all the best for Association’s future
         endeavours. I greatly appreciate your contribution to further development of networking with the University
         of Colombo. Buddhi Sarvathra Bhrajate, (translated from Sanskrit as) “Wisdom Enlightens''.

         SUWAYATA SAVIYAK FUNDRAISER
         As you know, Sri Lanka has been  experiencing very difficult
         time  during the  past  years  because  of  COVID-19  pandemic,
         economic crisis, fuel & food crisis etc. CUAAV has joined an
         initiative  organised  by  a  group  of  Australians  and  other
         associations  to  raise  funds  to  supply  essential  drugs  and
         equipment for the  Lady Ridgeway hospital and the  Colombo
         North  teaching  hospital  in  Ragama  for  children.  Suwayata
         Saviyak fundraising was launched on 10 June 2022. More than
         $120000 was raised and the money was donated to life-saving
         surgeries, critical medical equipment and medication for these
         hospitals.
         CUAAV  and  our  alumni  contributed  to  the  success  of  this
         fundraiser in various capacity. A part of raffle money collected
         at the Colombo Night 2022 was donated to this fundraiser.

         While helping to children’s hospitals in our motherland, we have
         also  donated  money  to  The  Royal  Children’s  Hospital

             CUAAV  joined  with  the  ‘Ride  for  Apeksha’  fundraiser  for  the
             cancer hospital in Sri Lanka. The purpose of the fundraiser was to
             raise  money  for  sending  critical  life-saving  cancer  drugs  and
             medical equipment that are in severe shortage due to economic
             crisis in Sri Lanka. The donation campaign was organised through
             participation of physical activities such as riding, running or walking.

             various capacity.







         CUAAV SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM


         As  you  are  well  aware,  CUAAV  has  been  maintaining  its  commitment  to  the  University  of  Colombo
         undergraduate  scholarship  program  and  it  has  been  carrying  out  with  the  partnership  of  University  of
         Colombo Graduates Association (UOCGA) in Sri Lanka. On behalf of CUAAV, thirty annual scholarships
         were awarded at a ceremony organised by UOCGA in July 2022. The ceremony was held online enabling
         us to connect with the Vice Chancellor, Senior Student Counsellor, UOCGA members and scholarship
         recipients. (Image: Scholarship award ceremony in July 2022 via Zoom).


















         The  CUAAV  scholarship  program  has  been  expanded  in  recent  years  to  encompass  all  faculties  and
         CUAAV has already offered a total of 145 annual scholarships to the University of Colombo undergraduate
         students. As someone who has supported University of Colombo students with a generous donation in the
         past, you understand how vital scholarships are to giving the students complete their higher education,
         regardless of their financial barriers or difficult life circumstances.


         CUAAV  acknowledges  past  scholarship  recipients  for  sharing  their  stories  on  achieving  their  career
         aspirations, thanks to the scholarships.

         Colombo students who want support can receive a scholarship. For the first time, CUAAV used a social
         media platform to raise funds and launched a Facebook fundraising campaign ‘Nanasata Saviyak’ targeting
         to raise funds for about 50 scholarships. With a simple act of kindness of public, we have successfully
         achieved our target as planned. CUAAV thanks Dr Ruwangi Chandrasekara (Head of Marketing, Faculty of
         Management & Finance) and Dr Rajith Silva (Senior Student Counsellor) for their support in providing video
         for fundraiser.

         We would like to send a heartfelt thank you to UOCGA for being there each step of the way by engaging
         the  process  of  selection  to  awarding funds  to  students  on  behalf  of  CUAAV.  It  was  not  an  easy  task,
         especially when the country was experiencing various turmoil in the last many months. The Association
         also  sincerely  acknowledges  all  the  hard  work  and  dedication  by  our  alumni  living  in  Victoria  and  the
         generosity of the wider Sri Lankan and Australian community in raising scholarship funds.
         CUAAV congratulates all scholarship recipients and wishes all the very best in their studies and beyond!


         OUR MEMBERSHIPS & COMMUNICATION

         Fifteen new financial members (15 life/annual) have obtained the membership and two annual members
         became life members during 2021-22. CUAAV has grown to 185 paid members (139 life and 46 annual) as
         of 30 June 2022. We have also established a QR code to improve membership application process.









         Both  member  and  non-member  alumni  were  informed  about  the  CUAAV  activities  via  email,  website,
         Facebook,  newsletters  and  occasional  text  messages.  The  website  and  Facebook  were  continuously
         updated with events and other relevant information. There are currently 681 followers and 652 likes showing
         the increase of about 50 likes for this year. As CUAAV FB page likes helping CUAAV to pass messages to
         a wider community, we have targeted 1000+ likes since there are more than 2000 alumni living in Victoria.


         CUAAV  newsletters  have  been  a  great communication  tool  to  keep  alumni  aware  of the  Association’s
         activities, news and up-coming events. Three newsletters during 2022 were circulated to CUAAV alumni
         and also uploaded to the Facebook and website. As part of fundraising towards CUAAV’s scholarships and
         IT costs, newsletters were open for sponsors to promote their business. About 183 followers are in the
         CUAAV LinkedIn page, which was established last year to improve networking among alumni.
