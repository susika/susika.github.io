These                  three  have  Mind  or  Consciousness  (vinnana)  as  their  forerunner,  because                  although they arise simultaneously with Mind they cannot arise if Mind does not                  arise.                    2. manasa ce padutthena: Manasa here means intention or volition (cetana);                  volition leads one to the performance of volitional actions, both good and evil.                  This volition and the resultant actions constitute kamma; and kamma always                  follows one to produce results. Cakkhupala's blindness                    3. dukkha: In this context, dukkha mens suffering, or physical or mental pain,                  misfortune, unsatisfactoriness, evil consequences, etc., and rebirth in the lower                  planes of existence or in the lower strata of human society if born in the human                  world.                                                                                                                                2","Cakkhupalatthera Vatthu - The Story of Thera                   Cakkhupala                    the Buddha While residing at the Jetavana monastery in Savatthi, the Buddha                  uttered the Verse of this book, with reference to Cakkhupala, a blind thera.                    On one occasion, Thera Cakkhupala came to pay homage to the Buddha at the                  Jetavana monastery. One night, while pacing up and down in meditation, the                  thera accidentally stepped on some insects. In the morning, some bhikkhus                  visiting  the  thera  found  the  dead  insects.  They  thought  ill  of  the  thera  and                  reported the matter to the Buddha. The Buddha asked them whether they had                  seen the thera killing the insects. When they answered in the negative, said,                   \"Just as you had not seen him killing, so also he had not seen those living                  insects. Besides, as the thera had already attained arahatship he could have                  no  intention  of  killing  and  so  was  quite  innocent.\"  On  being  asked  why                  Cakkhupala was blind although he was an arahat, the Buddha told the following                  story:                    Cakkhupala  was  a  physician  in  one  of  his  past  existences.  Once,  he  had                  deliberately made a woman patient blind. That woman had promised him to                  become his slave, together with her children, if her eyes were completely cured.                  Fearing that she and her children would have to become slaves, she lied to the                   physician. She told him that her eyes were getting worse when, in fact, they                  were  perfectly  cured.  The  physician  knew  she  was  deceiving  him,  so  in                  revenge, he gave her another ointment, which made her totally blind. As a result                  of  this  evil  deed  the  physician  lost  his  eyesight  many  times  in  his  later                  existences.                    Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:                     Verse 1: All mental phenomena have mind as their forerunner; they have mind                   as  their  chief;  they  are  mind-made.  If  one  speaks  or  acts  with  an  evil  mind,                   'dukkha' follows him just as the wheel follows the hoofprint of the ox that draws                   the cart.                       At the end of the discourse, thirty thousand bhikkhus attained arahantship.                                                                                                                     3","2                     Manopubbaṅgamā dhammā,                  manoseṭṭhā manomayā,                  manasā ce pasannena bhāsati vā karoti vā,                                         1                  tato naṁ sukham -anveti                   chāyā va anapāyinī                    All mental phenomena have mind as their forerunner; they have mind as their                  chief; they are mind-made.

Sukham/sukha: in this context, happiness, satisfactoriness, fortune, etc., and                  rebirth in the three upper planes of happy existence.                          ------------------  -----------                                                                                                                                               4","Matthakundali Vatthu - The Story of Matthakundali                    While residing at the Jetavana monastery in Savatthi, the Buddha uttered Verse  of this                  book,  with  reference  to  Matthakundali,  a  young  Brahmin.  Matthakundali  was  a  young                  brahmin, whose father, Adinnapubbaka, was very stingy and never gave anything in charity.                  Even  the  gold  ornaments  for  his  only  son  were  made  by  himself  to  save  payment  for                  workmanship. When his son fell ill, no physician was consulted, until it was too late. When                  he realized that his son was dying, he had the youth carried outside on to the verandah, so                  that people coming to his house would not see his possessions.                   On that morning, the Buddha arising early from his deep meditation of compassion saw, in                  his Net of Knowledge, Matthakundali lying on the verandah. So when entering Savatthi for                  alms-food  with  his  disciples,  the  Buddha  stood  near  the  door  of  the  brahmin                  Adinnapubbaka. The Buddha sent forth a ray of light to attract the attention of the youth,                  who was facing the interior of the house. The youth saw the Buddha; and as he was very                  weak he could only profess his faith mentally. But that was enough. When he passed away                  with his heart in devotion to the Buddha he was reborn in the Tavatimsa celestial world.                    From his celestial abode the young Matthakundali, seeing his father mourning over him at                  the cemetery, appeared to the old man in the likeness of his old self. He told his father                  about his rebirth in the Tavatimsa world and also urged him to approach and invite the                  Buddha to a meal. At the house of Adinnapubbaka the question of whether one could or                  could not be reborn in a celestial world simply by mentally professing profound faith in the                  Buddha, without giving in charity or observing the moral precepts, was brought up. So the                  Buddha willed that Matthakundali should appear in person; Matthakundali soon appeared                  fully decked with celestial ornaments and told them about his rebirth in the Tavatimsa world.                  Then only, the audience became convinced that the son of the brahmin Adinnapubbaka by                  simply devoting his mind to the Buddha had attained much glory.                   Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:                    All mental phenomena have mind as their forerunner; they have mind as their chief; they                  are mind-made. If one speaks or acts with a pure mind, happiness (sukha) follows him like                  a shadow that never leaves him.                   At the end of the discourse Matthakundali and his father Adinnapubbaka attained Sotapatti                  Magga and Sotapatti Phala. Adinnapubbaka also donated almost all his wealth to the cause                  of the Buddha's Teaching.                                                                                                                      5","3                    “Akkocchi maṁ, avadhi maṁ,                   ajini maṁ, ahāsi me”,                  ye ca taṁ upanayhanti                  veraṁ tesaṁ na sammati                      \"He abused me, he ill-treated me, he got the better of me, he stole my belongings;\"...                  the enmity of those harbouring such thoughts cannot be appeased”                                                                                                                                                                         6","4                   “Akkocchi maṁ,avadhi maṁ,                    ajini maṁ, ahāsi me”,                  ye taṁ na upanayhanti                  veraṁ tesūpasammati.                       \"He abused me, he ill-treated me, he got the better of me, he stole my belongings;\"...                  the enmity of those not harbouring such thoughts can be appeased.                                                        -----------------Art -------------------------                                                                                                                                                7","Tissatthera Vatthu - The Story of Thera Tissa                    While residing at the Jetavana monastery in Savatthi, the Buddha uttered Verses (3)                  and (4) of this book, with reference to Thera Tissa.                    Tissa, son of the Buddha's maternal aunt, was at one time staying with the Buddha.                  He had become a bhikkhu only in his old age, but he posed as a senior bhikkhu and                  was very pleased when visiting bhikkhus asked his permission to do some service                   for  him.  On  the  other  hand,  he  failed  to  perform  the  duties  expected  of  junior                  bhikkhus; besides, he often quarrelled with the younger bhikkhus. Should anyone                  rebuke him on account of his behaviour he would go complaining to the Buddha,                  weeping, very much dissatisfied and very upset. The others also followed him to the                  presence of the Buddha. The Buddha told them not to harbour thoughts of enmity,                  for enmity could only be appeased by not harbouring enmity.                    Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:                    Verse 3: \"He abused me, he ill-treated me, he got the better of me, he stole my                  belongings;\"... the enmity of those harbouring such thoughts cannot be appeased.                   Verse 4: \"He abused me, he ill-treated me, he got the better of me, he stole my                   belongings;\"... the enmity of those not harbouring such thoughts can be appeased.                   At  the  end  of  the  discourse,  one  hundred  thousand  bhikkhus  attained  Sotapatti                  Fruition.                                                                                                                                        8","5                     Na hi verena verāni                  sammantīdha kudācanaṁ,                  averena ca sammanti,                                                   1                  esa dhammo sanantano                  Hatred is, indeed, never appeased by hatred in this world.

Once there lived a householder, whose wife was barren; later he took another                   wife. The feud started when the elder wife caused abortion of the other one, who                  eventually died in child birth. In later existences the two were reborn as a hen and                  a  cat;  a  doe  and  a  leopardess;  and  finally  as  the  daughter  of  a  nobleman  in                  Savatthi and an ogress named Kali. The ogress (Kalayakkhini) was in hot pursuit                  of the lady with the baby, when the latter learned that the Buddha was nearby,                  giving a religious discourse at the Jetavana monastery. She fled to him and placed                  her son at his feet for protection. The ogress was stopped at the door by the                   guardian spirit of the monastery and was refused admission. She was later called                  in  and  both  the  lady  and  the  ogress  were  reprimanded  by  the  Buddha.  The                  Buddha told them about their past feuds as rival wives of a common husband, as                  a cat and a hen, and as a doe and a leopardess. They were made to see that                  hatred  could  only  cause  more  hatred,  and  that  it  could  only  cease  through                  friendship, understanding and goodwill.                       Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:                      Hatred is, indeed, never appeased by hatred in this world. It is appeased only                   by loving-kindness. This is an ancient law.                      At the end of the discourse, the ogress was established in Sotapatti Fruition and                  the long-standing feud came to an end.                                                                                                                           10","6                                               1                  Pare ca na vijānanti                                                   2                  mayam-ettha yamāmase ,                                              3                  ye ca tattha vijānanti                  tato sammanti medhagā.                       People, other than the wise, do not realize, \"We in this world must all die,\" (and,                  not realizing it, continue their quarrels). The wise realize it and thereby their                  quarrels cease.                       1. Pare ca na vijananti: 'Pare' means 'others'; in this context, people other than                  the wise. These people do not realize that they must die, and behave as if they                  were never going to die and keep on quarrelling. Therefore, they are sometimes                  referred to as the ignorant or the foolish, or those who are not worthy of love                  and respect.                    2. mayam-ettha yamamase: lit., \"We here must die,\" meaning we, of this world,                  must die; or all men are mortal.                    3. ye ca tattha vijananti: in the case of those who understand, meaning the                  wise. The wise understand (or realize) that all men are mortal.                                          ---------------------------- art -----------                                                                                                                                  11","Kosambaka Vatthu - The Story of Kosambi Bhikkhus                    While residing at the Jetavana monastery in Savatthi, the Buddha uttered Verse                  (6) of this book, with reference to the bhikkhus of Kosambi.                    The bhikkhus of Kosambi had formed into two groups. One group followed the                  master of Vinaya and the other followed the teacher of the Dhamma and they were                  often quarrelling among themselves. Even the Buddha could not stop them from                   quarrelling; so he left them and spent the vassa, residence period of the rains, all                  alone  in  Rakkhita  Grove  near  Palileyyaka  forest.  There,  the  elephant  Palileyya                  waited upon the Buddha.                    The  lay  disciples  of  Kosambi,  on  learning  the  reason  for  the  departure  of  the                  Buddha, refused to make offerings to the remaining bhikkhus. This made them                  realize their mistake and reconciliation took place among themselves. Still, the lay                  disciples would not treat them as respectfully as before, until they owned up their                  fault to the Buddha. But the Buddha was away and it was in the middle of the vassa;                  so the bhikkhus of Kosambi spent the vassa in misery and hardship.                    At  the  end  of  the  vassa,  the  Venerable  Ananda  and  five  hundred  bhikkhus                  approached the Buddha and gave the message from Annathapindika and other lay                  disciples  imploring  him  to  return.  In  due  course  the  Buddha  returned  to  the                  Jetavana monastery in Savatthi. The bhikkhus followed him there, fell down at his                  feet, and owned up their fault. The Buddha rebuked them for disobeying him. He                   told them to remember that they must all die some day and therefore, they must                  stop their quarrels and must not act as if they would never die.                   Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:                       Verse 6: People, other than the wise, do not realize, \"We in this world must all                   die,\"  (and,  not  realizing  it,  continue  their  quarrels).  The  wise  realize  it  and                   thereby their quarrels cease.                      At  the  end  of  the  discourse,  all  the  assembled  bhikkhus  were  established  in                  Sotapatti Fruition.                                                                                                                  12","7                     Subhānupassiṁ viharantaṁ,                  indriyesu asaṁvutaṁ,                  bhojanamhi amattaññuṁ,                   kusītaṁ hīnavīriyaṁ –                                             1                  taṁ ve pasahati Māro                  vāto rukkhaṁ va dubbalaṁ.

Mahakala                  and  Culakala  were  two  merchant  brothers  from  the  town  of  Setabya.  While                   travelling about with their merchandise on one occasion, they had a chance to listen                  to a religious discourse given by the Buddha. After hearing the discourse Mahakala                  asked the Buddha for admission to the Order of the bhikkhus. Culakala also joined                  the Order but with the intention of coming out of the Order and to bring out his                  brother along with him.                    Mahakala was serious in his ascetic practice at the cemetery (Sosanika dhutinga)                  and diligently meditated on decay and impermanence. He finally gained Insight and                  attain arahantship.                    Later, the Buddha and his disciples, including the brothers, happened to be staying                  in the forest of Simsapa, near Setabya. While staying there, the former wives of                  Culakala invited the Buddha and his disciples to their house. Culakala himself went                  ahead to prepare seating arrangements for the Buddha and his disciples. Once                  there, the former wives of Culakala made him change into lay clothes.                    The next day, the wives of Mahakala invited the Buddha and his disciples to their                  house hoping to do the same with Mahakala as the wives of Culakala had done to                  Culakala. After the  meal they requested the Buddha to let  Mahakala remain to                  \"express appreciation\" (anumodana). So the Buddha and the other disciples left.                    Arriving  at  the  village  gate  the  bhikkhus  expressed  their  dissatisfaction  and                  apprehension. They  were dissatisfied because  Mahakala  was permitted to stay                  behind and they were afraid that, like Culakala, his brother, Mahakala, too, would                  be made to leave the Order by his former wives. To this, the Buddha replied that                   the two brothers were not alike. Culakala indulged in sensual pleasures and was                  lazy and weak; he was just like a weak tree. Mahakala, on the other hand, was                  diligent,  steadfast  and  strong  in  his  faith  of  the  Buddha,  the  Dhamma  and  the                  Samgha; he was like a mountain of rock.                                                                                                                         15","Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:                   Verse 7: He who keeps his mind on pleasant objects, who is uncontrolled in his                   senses, immoderate in his food, and is lazy and lacking in energy, will certainly be                  overwhelmed by Mara, just as stormy winds uproot a weak tree.                   Verse  8:  He  who  keeps  his  mind  on  the  impurities  (of  the  body),  who  is  well-                  controlled  in  his  senses  and  is  full  of  faith  and  energy,  will  certainly  be  not                   overwhelmed by Mara, just as stormy winds cannot shake a mountain of rock.                   Meanwhile, the former wives of Mahakala surrounded him and tried to remove his                  yellow robes. The thera, sensing their attitude, stood up and rising up into the air by                   his supernormal powers passed through the roof of the house into the sky. He landed                  at the feet of the Buddha at the very moment the Master was coming to the end of                  his utterance of the above two stanzas. At the same time, all the bhikkhus assembled                  there were established in Sotapatti Fruition.                                                                                                                                                      16","9                                                1                  Anikkasāvo kāsāvaṁ                  yo vatthaṁ paridahessati,                  apeto damasaccena                   na so kāsāvam-arahati.

Once the two Chief Disciples, the Venerable Sariputta and the Venerable Maha                  Moggallana,  went  from  Savatthi  to  Rajagaha.  There,  the  people  of  Rajagaha                  invited  them,  with  their  one  thousand  followers,  to  a  morning  meal.  On  that                   occasion someone handed over a piece of cloth, worth one hundred thousand, to                  the organizers of the alms-giving ceremony. He instructed them to dispose of it                  and use the proceeds for the ceremony should there be any shortage of funds, or                  if there were no such shortage, to offer it to anyone of the bhikkhus they thought                  fit. It so happened that there was no shortage of anything and the cloth was to be                  offered to one of the theras. Since the two Chief Disciples visited Rajagaha only                  occasionally, the cloth was offered to Devadatta, who was a permanent resident                  of Rajagaha.                    Devadatta  promptly  made  the  cloth  into  robes  and  moved  about  pompously,                  wearing them. Then, a certain bhikkhu from Rajagaha came to Savatthi to pay                  homage to the Buddha, and told him about Devadatta and the robe, made out of                   cloth worth one hundred thousand. The Buddha then said that it was not the first                  time that Devadatta was wearing robes that he did not deserve. The Buddha then                  related the following story.                    Devadatta was an elephant hunter in one of his previous existences. At that time,                  in a certain forest, there lived a large number of elephants. One day, the hunter                  noticed  that  these  elephants  knelt  down  to  the  paccekabuddhas*  on  seeing                  them. Having observed that, the hunter stole an upper part of a yellow robe and                  covered his body and hand with it. Then, holding a spear in his hand, he waited                  for the elephants on their usual route. The elephants came, and taking him for a                   paccekabuddha fell down on their knees to pay obeisance. They easily fell prey                  to the hunter. Thus, one by one, he killed the last elephant in the row each day for                  many days.                   The Bodhisatta (the Buddha-to-be) was then the leader of the herd. Noticing the                   dwindling number of his followers he decided to investigate and followed his herd                  at the end of the line. He was alert, and was therefore able to evade the spear.                  He caught hold of the hunter in his trunk and was about to dash him against the                  ground, when he saw the yellow robe. Seeing the yellow robe, he desisted and                  spared the life of the hunter.                                                                                                            19","The hunter was rebuked for trying to kill under cover of the yellow robe and for                  commuting such an act of depravity. The hunter clearly did not deserve to put on                  the yellow robe.                    Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:                   Verse 9: He who is not free from taints of moral defilements (kilesas) and yet dons                  the yellow robe, who lacks restraint in his senses and (speaks not the) truth is                   unworthy of the yellow robe.                   Verse  10:  He  who  has  discarded  all  moral  defilements  (kilesas),  who  is                  established in moral precepts, is endowed with restraint and (speaks the) truth is,                   indeed, worthy of the yellow robe.                   At the end of the discourse, many bhikkhus were established in Sotapatti                  Fruition.                    * Paccekabuddha: One who, like the Buddha, is Self-Enlightened in the Four                  Noble Truths and has uprooted all the moral defilements (kilesas).

Upatissa and Kolita were two youths from Upatissa and Kolita, two villages near                   Rajagaha. While looking at a show they realized the insubstantiality of things and                  they decided to search for the way to liberation. First, they approached Sanjaya.                  the wandering ascetic at Rajagaha, but they were not satisfied with his teachings.                  So  they  went  all  over  Jambudipa  and  came  back  to  their  native  place,  after                  searching  for,  but  not  finding  the  true  dhamma.  At  this  point  they  came  to  an                  understanding that one who found the true dhamma should inform the other.                    One day, Upatissa came across Thera Assaji and learned from him the substance                  of  the  dhamma.  The  Thera  uttered  the  verse  beginning  with  \"Ye  dhamma                  hetuppabhava\",  meaning,  \"those  phenomena  which  proceed  from  a  cause\".                  Listening to the verse, Upatissa became established in the Sotapatti Magga and                  Phala. Then, as promised, he went to his friend Kolita, explained to him that he,                   Upatissa, had attained the state of Deathlessness and repeated the verse to his                  friend. Kolita also become established in Sotapatti Fruition at the end of the verse.                  They both remembered their former teacher and so went to Sanjaya and said to                  him,  \"We  have  found  one  who  could  point  out  the  Path  to  Deathlessness;  the                  Buddha has appeared in the world; the Dhamma has appeared; the Sangha has                  appeared... Come, let us go to the Teacher.\" They had hoped that their former                   teacher would go along with them to the Buddha and by listening to the discourses                  he, too, would come to realize Magga and Phala. But Sanjaya refused.                   So Upatissa and Kolita, with two hundred and fifty followers, went to the Buddha,                   at Veluvana. There, they were initiated and admitted into the Order as bhikkhus.                  Upatissa as son of Rupasari became known as Thera Sariputta; Kolita as son of                  Moggali became known as Thera Maha Moggallana. On the seventh day after the                  initiation  Maha  Moggallana  attained  Arahantship.  Thera  Sariputta  achieved  the                  same a fortnight after initiation. On that day, the Buddha made them his two Chief                  Disciples (Agga-Savaka).                    The two Chief Disciples then related to the Buddha how they went to the Giragga                  festival, the meeting with Thera Assaji and their attainment of Sotapatti Fruition.                  They also told the  Buddha about their former teacher Sanjaya,  who refused  to                                                                                                            23","accompany them. Sanjaya had said, \"Having been a teacher to so many pupils, for                  me to become his pupil would be like a jar turning into a drinking cup. Besides, only                  few people are wise and the majority are foolish; let the wise go to the wise Gotama,                  the foolish would still come to me. Go your way, my pupils.\"                    Thus, as the Buddha pointed out, Sanjaya's false pride was preventing him from                  seeing truth as truth; he was seeing untruth as truth and would never arrive at the                  real truth.                    Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:                       Verse 11: They take untruth for truth; they take truth for untruth; such persons                   can never arrive at the truth, for they hold wrong views.                    Verse 12: They take truth for truth; they take untruth for untruth; such persons                    arrive at the truth, for they hold right views. At the end of the discourse, many                   people came to be established in Sotapatti Fruition.

Once the Buddha was residing at the Veluvana monastery in Rajagaha when his                  father King Suddhodana repeatedly sent messengers to the Buddha requesting                  him to visit the city of Kapilavatthu. Accordingly, the Buddha made the journey in                   the company of twenty thousand arahats. On arrival at Kapilavatthu he related the                  Vessantara Jataka to the assembly of his relatives. On the second day, he entered                  the city, where by reciting the verse beginning with \"Uttitthe Nappamajjeyya ...\"                  (i.e., One should arise and should not be unmindful ...) he caused his father to be                  established  in  Sotapatti  Fruition.  On  arrival  at  the  palace,  the  Buddha  recited                  another  verse  beginning  with  \"Dhammam  care  sucaritam  ...\"  (i.e.,  One  should                  practise the Dhamma...) and established the king in Sakadagami Fruition*. After                  the  meal  he  narrated  the  Candakinnari  Jataka,  with  reference  to  the  virtues  of                   Rahula's mother.                   On the third day, there was the marriage ceremony of Prince Nanda, a cousin of                  the Buddha. The Buddha went there for alms and handed over the alms bowl to                   Prince Nanda. The Buddha then departed without taking back the bowl. So the                  prince,  holding  the  bowl,  had  to  follow  the  Buddha.  The  bride,  Princess                  Janapadakalyani, seeing the prince following the Buddha rushed forth and cried                  out to the prince to come back soon. At the monastery, the prince was admitted                  into the Order as a bhikkhu.                    Later, the Buddha moved into the monastery built by Anathapindika, at Jeta Park                  in Savatthi. While residing there Nanda was discontented and half-hearted and                  found little pleasure in the life of a bhikkhu. He wanted to return to the life of a                  householder  because  he  kept  on  remembering  the  words  of  Princess                   Janapadakalyani, imploring him to return soon.                   Knowing this, the Buddha, by supernormal power, showed Nanda, the beautiful                  female  devas  of  the  Tavatimsa  world  who  were  far  prettier  than  Princess                  Janapadakalyani. He promised to get them for Nanda, if the latter strove hard in                   the practice of the Dhamma. Other bhikkhus ridiculed Nanda by saying that he was                  like a hireling who practised the Dhamma for the sake of beautiful women, etc.                  Nanda felt very much tormented and ashamed. So, in seclusion, he tried very hard                  in the practice of the Dhamma and eventually attained arahatship. As an arahat his                  mind was totally released from all attachments, and the Buddha was also released                                                                                                            27","from his promise to Nanda. All this had been foreseen by the Buddha right from the                  very beginning.                    Other bhikkhus, having known that Nanda was not happy in the life of a bhikkhu,                  again  asked  him  how  he  was  faring. When  he  answered  that  he  had  no  more                  attachments to the life of a householder, they thought Nanda was not speaking the                  truth. So they informed the Buddha about the matter, at the same time expressing                  their doubts. The Buddha then explained to them that, previously, the nature of                  Nanda was like that of an ill-roofed house, but now, it had grown to be like a well-                   roofed one.                   Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:                       Verse 13: Just as rain penetrates a badly-roofed house, so also, passion (raga)                   penetrates  a  mind  not  cultivated  in  Tranquillity  and  Insight  Development                   (Samatha and Vipassana).                        Verse 14: Just as rain cannot penetrate a well-roofed house, so also, passion                   (raga)  cannot  penetrate  a  mind  well-cultivated  in  Tranquillity  and  Insight                   Development (Samatha and Vipassana).                      * Sakadagami Fruition: Sakadagami Phala, 'fruit' or 'fruition'.

Once, in a village not far away from the Veluvana monastery, there lived a very cruel                  and hard-hearted pork-butcher, by the name of Cunda. Cunda was a pork-butcher                  for over fifty-five  years; all this time  he  had  not  done a single meritorious  deed.                   Before he died, he was in such  great pain and agony that he  was grunting and                  squealing and kept on moving about on his hands and knees like a pig for seven                  whole days. In fact, even before he died, he was suffering as if he were in Niraya*.                  On the seventh day, the pork-butcher died and was reborn in Avici Niraya. Thus, the                  evil-doer must always suffer for the evil deeds done by him; he suffers in this world                  as well as in the next.                    In this connection, the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:                       Here he grieves, hereafter he grieves; the evil-doer grieves in both existences.

Once there lived in Savatthi, a lay disciple by the name of Dhammika, who was                  virtuous and very fond of giving in charity. He generously offered food and other                  requisites to the bhikkhus regularly and also on special occasions. He was, in fact,                  the leader of five hundred virtuous lay disciples of the Buddha who lived in Savatthi.                  Dhammika had seven sons and seven daughters and all of them, like their father,                  were virtuous and devoted to charity. When Dhammika was very ill and was on his                   death-bed he made a request to the Samgha to come to him and recite the sacred                  texts by his bedside. While the bhikkhus were reciting the Maha satipatthana Sutta,                  six  decorated  chariots  from  six  celestial  worlds  arrived  to  invite  him  to  their                  respective worlds. Dhammika told them to wait for a while for fear of interrupting the                  recitation of the Sutta. The bhikkhus, thinking that they were being asked to stop,                  stopped and left the place.                    A  little  while  later,  Dhammika  told  his  children  about  the  six  decorated  chariots                  waiting for him. Then and there he decided to choose the chariot from the Tusita                  world and asked one of his children to throw a garland on to it. Then he passed away                   and was reborn in the Tusita world. Thus, the virtuous man rejoices in this world as                  well as in the next.                   Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:                       Here he rejoices, hereafter he rejoices; one who performed meritorious deeds                   rejoices in both existences. He rejoices and greatly rejoices when he sees the                   purity of his own deeds.                                                                                                                              32","17                     Idha tappati, pecca tappati,                  pāpakārī ubhayattha tappati,                  “Pāpaṁ mĕ katan”-ti tappati,                                                  1                  bhiyyo tappati duggatiṁ  gato.

Devadatta was at one time residing with the Buddha in Kosambi. While staying there                  he realized that  the  Buddha  was receiving much respect and honour as  well  as                  offerings. He envied the Buddha and aspired to head the Order of the bhikkhus. One                  day, while the Buddha was preaching at the Veluvana monastery in Rajagaha, he                   approached the Buddha and on the ground that the Buddha was getting old, he                  suggested that the Order be entrusted to his care. The Buddha rejected his offer and                  rebuked him, saying that he was a swallower of other people's spittle. The Buddha                  next asked the Samgha to carry out an act of proclamation (Pakasaniya kamma*)                  regarding Devadatta.                    Devadatta felt aggrieved and vowed vengeance against the Buddha. Three times,                  he  attempted  to  kill  the  Buddha:  first,  by  employing  some  archers;  secondly,  by                  climbing up the Gijjhakuta hill and rolling down a big piece of rock on to the Buddha;                  and  thirdly,  by  causing  the  elephant  Nalagiri  to  attack  the  Buddha.  The  hired                  assassins returned after being established in Sotapatti Fruition, without harming the                  Buddha. The big piece of rock rolled down  by Devadatta  hurt the big toe  of the                   Buddha just a little, and when the Nalagiri elephant rushed at the Buddha, it was                  made docile by the Buddha. Thus Devadatta failed to kill the Buddha, and he tried                  another tactic. He tried to break up the Order of the bhikkhus by taking away some                  newly admitted bhikkhus with him to Gayasisa; however, most of them were brought                  back by Thera Sariputta and Thera Maha Moggallana.                    Later, Devadatta fell ill. He had been ill for nine months when he asked his pupils to                  take him to the Buddha, and subsequently made the trip to the Jetavana monastery.                  Hearing that Devadatta was coming, the Buddha told his disciples that Devadatta                  would never get the opportunity to see him.                    When  Devadatta  and  his  party  reached  the  pond  in  the  Jetavana  monastery                  compound the carriers put down the couch on the bank of the pond and went to take                  a bath. Devadatta also rose from his couch and placed both his feet on the ground.                   Immediately,  his  feet  sank  into  the  earth  and  he  was  gradually  swallowed  up,                  Devadatta did not have the opportunity to see the Buddha because of the wicked                  deeds he had done to the Buddha. After his death, he was reborn in Avici Niraya, a                  place of intense and continuous torment.                    Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:                                                                                                              34","Verse  17:  Here  he  is  tormented,  hereafter  he  is  tormented;  the  evil-doer  is                   tormented in both existences.

In Savatthi, at the house of Anathapindika and the house of Visakha, two thousand                  bhikkhus were served with food daily. At the house of Visakha, the offering of alms-                  food  was  supervised  by  her  granddaughter.  At  the  house  of  Anathapindika,  the                  supervision was done, first by the eldest daughter, next by the second daughter and                   finally  by  Sumanadevi,  the  youngest  daughter.  The  two  elder  sisters  attained                  Sotapatti Fruition by listening to the Dhamma, while serving food to the bhikkhus.                  Sumanadevi did even better and she attained Sakadagami Fruition.                   Later, Sumanadevi fell ill and on her death-bed she asked for her father. Her father                   came, and she addressed her father as \"younger brother\" (Kanittha bhatika) and                  passed away soon after. Her form of address kept her father wondering and made                  him uneasy and depressed, thinking that his daughter was delirious and not in her                  right senses at the time of her death. So, he approached the Buddha and reported                  to him about his daughter, Sumanadevi. Then the Buddha told the noble rich man                  that his daughter was in her right senses and fully self-possessed at the time of her                  passing  away.  The  Buddha  also  explained  that  Sumanadevi  had  addressed  her                   father as \"younger brother\" because her attainment of Magga and Phala was higher                  than that  of her father's. She  was a Sakadagam  whereas her father  was only a                  Sotapanna. Anathapindika was also told that Sumanadevi was reborn in the Tusita                  deva world.                    Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:                      Here he is happy, hereafter he is happy; one who performs meritorious deeds is                    happy in both existences. Happily he exclaims: I have done meritorious deeds.\"                   He is happier still when he is reborn in a higher world (suggati).                                                                                                                          37","19                     Bahum-pi ce sahitaṁ1 bhāsamāno,                  na takkaro2 hoti naro pamatto,                  gopo va gāvo gaṇayaṁ paresaṁ,                   na bhāgavā sāmaññassa hoti.

Once there were two friends of a noble family, two bhikkhus from Savatthi. One of                  them  learned  the  Tipitaka  and  was  very  proficient  in  reciting  and  preaching  the                  sacred texts. He taught five hundred bhikkhus and became the instructor of eighteen                   groups of bhikkhus. The other bhikkhu striving diligently and ardently in the course                  of Insight Meditation attained arahantship together with Analytical Insight.                   On one occasion, when the second bhikkhu came to pay homage to the Buddha, at                   the Jetavana monastery, the two bhikkhus met. The master of the Tipitaka did not                  realize that the other had already become an arahant. He looked down on the other,                  thinking that this old bhikkhu knew very little of the sacred texts, not even one out of                  the five Nikayas or one out of the three Pitakas. So he thought of putting questions                  to the other, and thus embarass him. The Buddha knew about his unkind intention                  and he also knew that as a result of giving trouble to such a noble disciple of his, the                  learned bhikkhu would be reborn in a lower world.                    So, out of compassion, the Buddha visited the two bhikkhus to prevent the scholar                  from questioning the other bhikkhu. The Buddha himself did the questioning. He put                  questions on jhanas and maggas to the master of the Tipitaka; but he could not                  answer them because he had not practised what he had taught. The other bhikkhu,                   having practised the Dhamma and having attained arahatship, could answer all the                  questions.  The  Buddha  praised  the  one  who  practised  the  Dhamma  (i.e.,  a                  vipassaka), but not a single word of praise was spoken for the learned scholar (i.e.,                  a ganthika).                    The resident disciples could not understand why the Buddha had words of praise for                  the old bhikkhu and not for their learned teacher. So, the Buddha explained the                  matter  to  them.  The  scholar  who  knows  a  great  deal  but  does  not  practise  in                  accordance with the Dhamma is like a cowherd, who looks after the cows for wages,                  while the one who practises in accordance with the Dhamrna is like the owner who                  enjoys the five kinds of produce of the cows*. Thus, the scholar enjoys only the                   services rendered to him by his pupils but not the benefits of Magga-phala. The other                  bhikkhu, though he knows little and recites only a little of the sacred texts, having                  clearly comprehended the essence of the Dhamma and having practised diligently                  and strenuously, is an 'anudhammacari'**, who has eradicated passion, ill will and                  ignorance.  His  mind  being  totally  freed  from  moral  delilements  and  from  all                                                                                                            40","attachments  to  this  world  as  well  as  to  the  next,  he  truly  shares  the  benefits  of                  Magga-phala.                    Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:                   Verse 19: Though he recites much the Sacred Texts (Tipitaka), but is negligent and                  does not practise according to the Dhamma, like a cowherd who counts the cattle of                  others, he has no share in the benefits of the life of a bhikkhu (i.e., Magga-phala).
