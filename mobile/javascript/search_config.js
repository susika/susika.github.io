Kāshyapa  Thero  had  some to those who we are in debt.                                                                                                y                 resemblance to the Lord Buddha and people often mistook                 one for the other. A local woman who was longing to offer                some  sweet  cakes  to  Kāshyapa  Thero  saw  the  Buddha                approaching and having mistaken Him for Kāshyapa Thero                placed the cakes in His alms bowl and having accepted the                offering the Buddha continued on his way. However, a few                moments  later  when  Kāshyapa  Thero  approached,  the                woman soon realised her mistake and ran after the Buddha                to retrieve her offering.

Kāshyapa  Thero  had  some to those who we are in debt.                                                                                                y                 resemblance to the Lord Buddha and people often mistook                 one for the other. A local woman who was longing to offer                some  sweet  cakes  to  Kāshyapa  Thero  saw  the  Buddha                approaching and having mistaken Him for Kāshyapa Thero                placed the cakes in His alms bowl and having accepted the                offering the Buddha continued on his way. However, a few                moments  later  when  Kāshyapa  Thero  approached,  the                woman soon realised her mistake and ran after the Buddha                to retrieve her offering. The Lord Buddha in His infinite                compassion determined the woman should only be able to                see the cakes she had offered in the alms bowl and nothing                else,  as  if  she  were  to  take  anything  else  she  would  be                         - For non-commercial distribution only - - For non-commercial distribution only -","","35                  Virtue                                            34                        stringently one abides not only by the letter but also spirit                                                                                          of these precepts the more merit he or she can accumulate                                                                                          as a result.

Examples  of  attending  and  contributing  to  sacred                places include organising religious programmes, attending                to the needs of the clergy as well as visitors and tidying up                the       shrine           or      grounds            belonging               to      the                temple/church/mosque premises etc. While there are some                who go as far as dedicating their life to the upkeep of such                establishments,  usually  with  understanding  of  and                inclination  towards  the  fundamental  principles  of  the                religious  teaching  or  philosophy  to  a  greater  or  lesser                extent, there are others whose devotion is limited to blind                faith. Sometimes their devotion is driven by sentiments of                duty and responsibility, rather than an understanding and                         - For non-commercial distribution only - - For non-commercial distribution only -","","58                                                                                            meaning from the terms “worth”, which is the condition of                 Revering those worthy of reverence                                                                                          59                                                                                          being worthy + “-ship”, which is the state of denoting a                                                                                          quality or condition.

What                this means is that this deed will not bring the doer rebirth in                the  woeful  plane,  but  may  bear  fruit  by  bringing                unfavourable,  unpleasant  consequences  in  the  same or a                future birth.                      Our readers may recall from a previous issue, the                                                        ,                Lord  Buddha  states  that  volition  (                                                                          c                                                                       n                                                                    u                                                                              d                                                                           e                                                           r                                                         p                                                              o                                                                  o                                                                n                                                fÉ;kdj                “chēthnāva”) itself is the deed (karma). Therefore, when we                perform a deed, it is the thoughts which take place in our                mind  which  generates  the  karmic  energy.  Volition  is  a                mental-factor  (ronounced  “chaithasikaya”)                                         p                                         ,                             ffp;islh                which arises with the consciousness in the mind. As it is the                mind which  takes precedence  in committing  a  deed,  the                karmic energy released throughout the act of performing a                deed is dependent on the nature of one’s thoughts. As we                know,  it  is  unwholesome  deeds  which  bring  us  pain,                hardship and discomfort.

What                this means is that this deed will not bring the doer rebirth in                the  woeful  plane,  but  may  bear  fruit  by  bringing                unfavourable,  unpleasant  consequences  in  the  same or a                future birth.

Therefore, when we                perform a deed, it is the thoughts which take place in our                mind  which  generates  the  karmic  energy.  Volition  is  a                mental-factor  (ronounced  “chaithasikaya”)                                         p                                         ,                             ffp;islh                which arises with the consciousness in the mind. As it is the                mind which  takes precedence  in committing  a  deed,  the                karmic energy released throughout the act of performing a                deed is dependent on the nature of one’s thoughts. As we                know,  it  is  unwholesome  deeds  which  bring  us  pain,                hardship and discomfort.

precinct  is  a  hugely                 meritorious  deed  which  will  accrue  vast  amounts  of                positive karmic energy potentially reaping rewards up until                and contributing to one’s enlightenment.                      Although you have clearly stated this is not the case,                let  us  assume  for  a  moment  that  you  sweep  the  insects                intending to kill or cause them harm. As the karmic energy                you would accrue is  a product of both intention and the                virtuous moral quality of the animal being killed (we will                discuss  this  further  in  the  next  issue),  even  if  malign                intention exists, as it is the life of a lowly life form that is                taken, the karmic energy of the sin committed is miniscule                in comparison to the merits acquired by sweeping the Bodhi                precinct. To offer an analogy, like a pinch of salt makes no                difference  to  the  saltiness  of  the  great  oceans,  the  sin                committed  in  comparison  to  the  merits  acquired  here  is                negligible. Therefore, it would be unwise for one to be put                off  of  committing  this  meritorious  deed  for  fear  of                committing a sin.                      Be that as it may, you have clearly stated that you                have  no  intention  of  harming  insects,  but  it  is  an                unintentional  consequence  when  you  sweep  the  Bodhi                         - For non-commercial distribution only - - For non-commercial distribution only -","83                                                                  82                                                                                                     i                                                                                                                  t                                                                                                                         s                                                                                                              I                                                                                                                      i                                                                                                                    h                                                                                               e                                                                                                              n                                                                                            r                                                                                                 c                                                                                                     n                                                                                                                              e                                                                                                           t                                                                                                            .                 very  vile,  despicable  deed  and  therefore  is  considered  a ries  of  articles,  we  have  repeatedly                                                                                                       c                                                                                           p                                                                                                                            s                                                                                            m                                                                                                                 t                                                                                                        i                                                                                                     s                                                                                                            e                                                                                                          s                                                                                                 h                                                                                               p                                                                                                   a                                                                                                              d                                                                                                                        t                                                                                                                     a                                                                                                                             n                                                                                                                           i                                                                                                                    h                                                                                          e                lowly life form.

contributing to one’s enlightenment.                      Although you have clearly stated this is not the case,                let  us  assume  for  a  moment  that  you  sweep  the  insects                intending to kill or cause them harm. As the karmic energy                you would accrue is  a product of both intention and the                virtuous moral quality of the animal being killed (we will                discuss  this  further  in  the  next  issue),  even  if  malign                intention exists, as it is the life of a lowly life form that is                taken, the karmic energy of the sin committed is miniscule                in comparison to the merits acquired by sweeping the Bodhi                precinct. To offer an analogy, like a pinch of salt makes no                difference  to  the  saltiness  of  the  great  oceans,  the  sin                committed  in  comparison  to  the  merits  acquired  here  is                negligible. Therefore, it would be unwise for one to be put                off  of  committing  this  meritorious  deed  for  fear  of                committing a sin.                      Be that as it may, you have clearly stated that you                have  no  intention  of  harming  insects,  but  it  is  an                unintentional  consequence  when  you  sweep  the  Bodhi                         - For non-commercial distribution only - - For non-commercial distribution only -","","85                 Lying                                             84                        complete.

Among them, the advent of a Supreme                Buddha  is  extremely  rare.  He  proclaims  the  Dhamma,                                                                                                 Again, the intensity of the intention as well as the                which  is  the  universal,  indisputable,  absolute  truth.  The                                                                                          virtue  of  the  person  being  lied  to  are  the  factors  which                core of His teaching is that all universal conditioned entities                                                                                           determine the severity of this sin.                (which includes everything in the world, all forms of life                and  the  cosmos)  are  essenceless,  not  a  true  source  of                  fulfilment but rather a potential source of endless agitation,                agony and vexation. He teaches us the ultimate truth, which                is the only salvation for all sentient beings to escape every                form of suffering. As we have discussed in previous issues,                birth in the blissful plane is also extremely rare. So, when a                being is fortunate enough to not only be born in the blissful                plane as a human, dēva or brahma, but also during an era in                which a Buddha’s teaching prevails, there is no greater loss                and  misfortune  than  not  having  the  opportunity  to                understand  the  ultimate  reality  leading  to  ultimate                happiness.  Deliberately  depriving  someone  of  this  most                rare opportunity is an atrocious cruelty. Nevertheless, some                people  still  do  this.  In  contradiction  to  the  Buddha’s                teaching they claim the sansāric journey is to one’s liking,                satisfying and a source of pleasure and joy, meaningful and                         - For non-commercial distribution only - - For non-commercial distribution only -","86                                                                                                                                            87                                                                                            t                                                                                            h                                                                                                                  o                                                                                                   e                                                                                                            e                      Lying, in relation to Buddhist teaching also has a thy  of  continuing  existence.

He teaches us the ultimate truth, which                is the only salvation for all sentient beings to escape every                form of suffering. As we have discussed in previous issues,                birth in the blissful plane is also extremely rare. So, when a                being is fortunate enough to not only be born in the blissful                plane as a human, dēva or brahma, but also during an era in                which a Buddha’s teaching prevails, there is no greater loss                and  misfortune  than  not  having  the  opportunity  to                understand  the  ultimate  reality  leading  to  ultimate                happiness.  Deliberately  depriving  someone  of  this  most                rare opportunity is an atrocious cruelty. Nevertheless, some                people  still  do  this.  In  contradiction  to  the  Buddha’s                teaching they claim the sansāric journey is to one’s liking,                satisfying and a source of pleasure and joy, meaningful and                         - For non-commercial distribution only - - For non-commercial distribution only -","","89                 Slandering                                        88                        today in friends of couples in relationships.

Sexual                                                                                          misconduct  is  defined  as  engagement  in  sexual  activity                                                                                          which  does  not  conform  to  commonly  accepted  societal                                                                                          norms and decorum. This generally includes engaging in                                                                                          sexual activity with or without consent, with a person who                                                                                          is under the custody of parents, siblings or spouse and such                                                                                          a  relationship  is  not  approved  by  the  custodian.  Such                                                                                          behaviour is detrimental to the fabric of social harmony as                                                                                          it  undermines  mutual  trust  and  respect  between  people.                                                                                          Therefore, in civil society, it is expected that people refrain                                                                                          from sexual misconduct. Some jurisdictions also legislate                                                                                          against sexual misconduct.                                                                                                  There is no doubt that inappropriate engagement in                                                                                          sexual activity is harmful, however, the definition of what                                                                                          can  be classified as inappropriate in the arena  of  human                                                                                          relationships  is  evidently  diverse  across  cultures  and                                                                                          subject to change over time. For instance, premarital sex                                                                                          was an  offence  in some cultures and  it still is in others.

Sexual pleasure is generally derived                via the sense of touch. But touch is only one of the five  indulge  in  sensuality.
