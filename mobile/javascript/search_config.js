This        is the first Colombo Night held in three years due to the COVID        pandemic  and resulting  restrictions.  In addition to  raising        funds  for  important  community  projects  and  providing        networking opportunities, we know this eagerly awaited get-        together  brings  friends and family members  of our alumni        together for a wonderful evening of music,  dancing and        companionship.         It is an absolute honor to serve as the president of Colombo        University Alumni Association of Victoria and to work with a        group of dedicated committee members to achieve our shared        vision  and  goals.  Thanks to the  tireless  efforts of  my        committee, CUAAV was able to organise several events in 2022, engaging its members with other        university alumni members and the wider community.         2022 has been a successful year so far. The Colombo-Japura cricket match was played with the spirit        of camaraderie and the occasion was made even more special by the DJ and papare music playing in        the backdrop. We had several new young and talented players joining our team this year. Both alumni        members and their families had a great time and gained the opportunity to establish and extend        friendships within and between the two universities. CUAAV members and their families participated        in the Clean-up Australia Day where they joined hands with a local community organisation to clean        up the Bellbird Dell Reserve in Vermont. The blood and plasma donation drive in collaboration with        Australian Red Cross was successfully held in three locations of northern, western and eastern suburbs        of Melbourne and we had more than 30 alumni, family members and friends taking part this year.         “Karaoke Night” was another successful event jointly organised by the alumni chapters of University        of Colombo VIC and NSW. It was a unique musical experience for both alumni members with live        streaming via Zoom and Facebook while the VIC side of the event also had the participation of Sri        Lankan guest artists, followed by a buffet dinner. Another objective of this event was to launch the        Facebook fundraising campaign in support of CUAAV “Nanasata Saviyak” scholarship program helping        the University of Colombo undergraduates from all faculties who are facing financial hardships. Our        target was to raise funds for 50 scholarships for this year. This was the first time the CUAAV had used        a social media platform to raise funds. I am delighted to announce we have successfully raised the        funds for 50 scholarships as planned. I would like to thank all the University of Colombo graduates,        their families, friends and distinguished guests for attending this event.         I also acknowledge our past presidents and committee members for their continuous support and        encouragement.  Further  I  take  this opportunity to thank all  our sponsors  and partners  for their        generous contributions and support to make this night memorable.         Finally, I wish to highlight the dedication and hard work of my committee members whose efforts        resulted in this beautiful event. Tonight’s celebration is truly a team effort. I sincerely thank the        2022 committee members for their dedication and contribution, while gratefully acknowledging the        understanding and support of their families.         Thank you so much for joining us tonight. Just by taking part, you have contributed directly to the        scholarship fund and to the betterment in lives of not only of our recipients, but also their family        members too. We hope to see you again next year at the Colombo Night 2023. Enjoy the night!         Indika Mohottige        President, CUAAV 2022","MESSAGE FROM VICE CHANCELLOR FOR COLOMBO NIGHT 2022          It gives me great pleasure and honor to address you all at        this memorable event. First of all, I would like to        congratulate you on your achievements after graduating        from the University of Colombo.  The University  of        Colombo is the  number one prestigious university in Sri        Lanka. According to the webometrics ranking index of        Universities, the  University of Colombo has secured its        Island rank as number one and the world rank as 1531 as        of July 2022. As you are aware, the per capita income of        Sri Lanka has been less than USD 4000, and the University        of Colombo provides education facilities for 13,000        undergraduates and more than 12,000 external, distant,        and postgraduate students.         Sri  Lanka has been facing a bunch of  crises  such as the Easter attack, COVID-19 pandemic,        economic crisis, fuel crisis, food crisis, political crisis, and social crisis during the past 4 years. As        a result, the majority of the faculties and institutes of the University of Colombo had to operate        in online mode while the Faculty of Medicine remained open throughout the period. Since 2021,        most faculties are institutes shifted to multimode education. Today we follow a blended learning        approach, which mixes physical lectures, practical training, and examinations while conducting        online lectures. Our ultimate goal is to  reach 100% physical  operation as early as possible.        However, universities in Sri Lanka are running with great difficulties due to the significant cut        down of government annual monetary allocations. The government of Sri Lanka has issued several        financial circulars to cut down its expenditure on Universities.         Networking is one of the most important human activities in  the  world today. In  this  regard,        today’s event is significant. Needless to say, all universities in Australia are fee-charging, but their        graduates strongly support their universities via alumni associations. I appreciate your contribution        made towards the University of Colombo by providing scholarships to undergraduate students. It        has been really helpful to the underprivileged students of the University. I take this opportunity        to express my sincere  gratitude to the alumni association for your  contribution made to the        development of our undergraduate students. The University of Colombo is committed to        developing extracurricular activities such as sports, language skills,  performing arts-related        activities such as music, dancing, and cultural programs, speech craft competitions, leadership        development programs, ICT skills, financial literacy programs, and entrepreneurship development        programs.  I hope networking with your alumni association is important to implement these        activities in the university.         The University of Colombo seeks your continuous support in cooperative and collaborative areas        such as improvement of living conditions in hostels, development of extracurricular activities,        finding internship opportunities for (final year) students, initiating student exchange programs        with universities in Australia, and mentoring students through virtual fostering programs, etc.         I wish you all the very best and appreciate your contribution to further developing networking        with  the  University  of  Colombo.

Staying true to its stated motto, ‘Wisdom        Enlightens’, our university has proudly educated and empowered the lives of an abundance of students        for more than 100 years. There are students hailing from all walks of life in our university and providing        scholarships to undergraduate students who are facing financial hardship is an important objective of        the Colombo University Alumni Association of Victoria (CUAAV). Thanks to hard work of alumni since the        inauguration of CUAAV, our scholarship program was launched in December 2012 and twelve students        from several departments in the Faculties of Arts and Science received scholarships.         CUAAV continues its commitment        to the scholarship program in        partnership with the University of        Colombo Graduates Association        (UOCGA)  in  Sri  Lanka  (formerly        known  as  Sarasavi Mithuro).        UOCGA is an alumni association        formed by University of Colombo        past  graduates,  and  is  closely        working with the University’s        College  House  including  the        Student       Registrar     and        Counsellors’ Offices to provide        bursaries   to    undergraduate        students. The CUAAV scholarship        program has been expanded  in        recent years to encompass all faculties and provided 46 scholarships last year alone. (Photo: Scholarship        award ceremony in July 2022 via Zoom).        The scholarship’s financial assistance, provided throughout the undergraduate years, enables students        to concentrate on their studies there by giving them the best chance to thrive in their chosen field of        study. CUAAV has been receiving letters of appreciation from scholarship recipients and a few are shown        below after removing students’ names in order to protect their privacy.            “I am writing to you regarding the educational scholarship. As a scholarship recipient, I write to express my sincere          gratitude for the great contribution you gave to my educational life. The Scholarship is really important to my further          education. Thank you very much for your help and I wish you all good luck”. (2012)          I'm a student of science faculty, university of Colombo. I have got a scholarship from your association, through the          \"Sarasavi Mithuro\" association. Thank you so much for helping to students like me. (2019)          “I am a 3rd year student of faculty of management and finance, and I have received the Scholarship payments from March          2020 onwards. Thank you very much.”           I am a 4th year student from Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo. I have been receiving financial aid from          Colombo University Alumni Association of Victoria through the Sarasawi Mithuro Scholarship programme since I was in          2nd year. Your kind donation helped me immensely to get through these 2 years in the university. With your help I          could afford my basic necessities like food, accommodation and also some academic essentials like text books and a          stethoscope….. (2021)          The Association sincerely acknowledges all of the hard work and dedication by our alumni living in        Victoria and the generosity of the wider Sri Lankan and Australian community in raising scholarship        funds. CUAAV is looking forward to continuing our partnership with UOCGA to provide scholarships, with        more students set to benefit from your generosity in years to come.        If you wish to contribute towards scholarships to support undergraduate students at the University of        Colombo or for further information, please feel free to contact the Association by sending an email to        info@cuaav.org.au. Your generous support offers a gift back to the university and is crucial in making a        difference in students’ lives.        CUAAV sends our best wishes for all scholarship recipients in their studies.","GOLD SPONSOR","Discover Sri Lanka and its multifaceted magnificence with daily non-stop                                 flights from Melbourne and weekly from Sydney to Colombo and                           beyond.
